## How to contribute to vv

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities**,
    instead reach out privately to @zachaysan. You should get a
    response within three business days. If you don't you hit his spam
    filter. Make a vague Github issue.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching
    current issues.

* Still need to make an issue? Be sure to include a **title and
  clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.
  Please have steps to re-create the issue *from scratch* if at
  all possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Try to keep PRs small.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and
  solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please squash commits that are effectively one simple change into a
  single commit. So if your patch changes a method and the test for
  the method, keep both changes in a single commit.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Performance changes: Great! Prototype it out to make sure it
  works, then make an issue with the suggestion.

* Security-by-default changes: Same.

* Extending functionality: Maybe? Privately contact
  @zachaysan.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* Great, go nuts.
